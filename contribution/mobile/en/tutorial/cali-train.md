### What is the Calibration Train Fund?

The community can raise funds to start a calibration train, which consists of +1 to +10 calibration chance and destruction prevention buff.
The system will deploy each buff in increments, with intervals of 40 minutes, SLANC will also send a ping to @everyone on our discord #event channel when a fund has reached 100%

### How do I know when will the Calibration Train Fund start?
