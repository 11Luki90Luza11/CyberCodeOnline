### What is the Calibration Train Fund?

The community can raise funds to start a calibration train, which consists of +1 to +10 calibration chance and destruction prevention buff.
The system will deploy each buff in increments, with intervals of 40 minutes, SLANC will also send a ping to @everyone on our discord #event channel when a fund has reached 100%

### Can I combine regular calibration boosts with the Calibration Train event?

No, from a few minutes before the calibration train starts until the end of the event, the system will prevent players from using regular calibration boosts. this is to prevent players from wasting their boosts during the event or potentially interfering with the calibration train.
