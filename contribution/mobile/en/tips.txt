You can sell your items in the [PLAYER MARKET].
Your inventory has a storage limit; keep an eye on it or you will lose loot.
SCAVENGE to find components for crafting ammo and medicine.
Unequip upgrade modules when switching equipped gear to make them available for the new gear.
You can store excess upgrade modules in High Quality equipment to save inventory space.
Confused about the equipment cache you just found? Go to the [MOLECULAR 3D PRINTER] and make some gear.
Equipment caches come in 6 rarities: Trash, Common, High Quality, Rare, Legendary, and Epic.
Epic caches are extremely rare. Consider yourself incredibly lucky if you get one.
Low on BTC? Try scavenging for parts and sell or recycle them for profit!
Higher SCAVENGE skill allows you to scavenge in higher level areas and get more loot.
Have you looked at your inventory or thought of doing any crafting yet? Because you should!
Secret Key Fragments appear in both normal and challenge dungeons.
Always check the market prices before putting something up for sale!
Scrap your unused items to get Tech Scraps; you will need them to open locked containers and to trade for bags that increase your inventory.
After the early game, Pain Aways become virtually useless to heal with, so feel free to recycle them for a 50% chance of a Medical Tech Part per Pain Away.
If you can't afford to print a certain quality of equipment cache, try checking out the [PLAYER MARKET] first and seek cheaper alternatives. You might find affordable items for your level.
Inventory management is crucial.
You can obtain a steady source of AI Cores and Hash Processors by defeating the boss in a challenge difficulty dungeon.
Remember to max out your PRINTING RANK before printing your equipment.
Did you find a locked container? You can open it in [TERMINAL], but you'll need some Tech Scrap and BTC.
If you feel your inventory is constantly full, now might be a good time to consider that new backpack upgrade.
You can machine craft more Tech Scraps at the [GANG] via Automatic Recycler.
If you need BTC, try selling unused or unwanted items to the Weaponsmith. The "BARGAIN" stat also helps increase the items' sell price.
Inventory getting full? Lost BTC when you flatlined? Store items or BTC in the [BANK OF ARASAKA].

// Experience, Leveling
Your crafting ranks cannot exceed your level; don't waste time doing crafting research when the levels become the same.
You can reverse engineer scraps at [JOB HUB] to gain printing exp.
"Trash" quality equipment is useful for getting tech scraps, gaining printing exp, and increasing gear score for AI farming.
Level up a skill at the [COMMERCIAL AREA] when you have time to spare.
Studies show that mobs with the "Agile" tag grant more exp.
Not leveling as fast as you'd like? Try dungeon diving! You get twice the EXP from dungeons; and 2.3x for gang dungeons.
The gear you get from the [MOLECULAR PRINTER] is based on your Printing level and NOT your player level, so always keep your printing level up.
It's impossible to gain EXP and loot from enemies 3 gear levels or AI cores in areas 10 levels below you to keep the game fresh.
Fight enemies and dungeons above your level for more juicy exp.
Wait until someone uses the 180% EXP buff to redeem dungeon quest rewards to gain greater experience.
Doing challenge dungeons with other players is the fastest way to gain levels while having fun!
Complete quests for some BTC, EXP, and even items or temporary buffs!
How to level up faster? Stay away from chat.
To craft a key to unlock the next area, you need to travel to all three sub-areas and get the key in each dungeon boss room.
Is an area locked even though you unlocked it with a key? You may be underleveled.
SCAVENGING or doing AFK tasks at [COMMERCIAL AREA] has little impact on your inventory space.
When your level is high, you might notice that quests do not impact your BTC balance or your XP. You can still do them for fun or temporary boosts.
Printing high quality caches is significantly more expensive than printing common and trash caches.
Only the first area (level 1-4 area) has no requirements when scavenging. As a complete beginner to the skill, you must start there and gain a few levels first.
Mining is difficult to level, as it needs a large sum of money and AFK time with no immediate gain. Hold off on it until you reach at least level 400 or use gang supply crates to level.
When leveling mining below level 400 using hashes, it is best to wait for the so-called trinity buff — 100% Transaction Exploit, 80% Synaptic Acceleration, and a Frontal Cortex Enhancement to minimize BTC losses and maximize XP gained.
Past level 150, no new crafting recipes are unlocked for Medical Science. Just move on to leveling other skills as you need not level it any further unless you are doing so to fill up your pentagon.
Ammo Crafting is not as useful early on as it is cost-inefficient, but later on, it becomes more useful as more ammo is crafted, notably antimatter charges to start using destructive weapons consistently.
Sometimes it is best to strategically hold off from leveling your printing level so that you can make upgrade modules for your lowest leveled gear.
When using AI cores, XP and BTC gained are based on your gear score, regardless of rarity. While AI farming, get gear as close to your level as possible for more XP!
Did someone pop a Frontal Cortex Enhancement? Use the extra XP to grind dungeons. A Synaptic Accelerator? Maybe do some AFK tasks at a faster speed.
Want to make money quickly? With a Synaptic Accelerator up, scavenge for tech parts and recycle these parts at a gang recycler for tech scrap to sell, all while leveling scavenging up for higher tech part gains.
What's the simplest way to level faster? Don't die. Consistency is better than speed. Take your time to avoid any deaths and find a rhythm that works for you before working on speed.
Early on, dungeons and AI farming are about equal in XP efficiency. AI farming is death-free, not as hands-on, but consumes a lot of money. Decide between money or automation.
You CANNOT upgrade the level of gear once you have already printed it. That gear will stay the same level forever until scrapped, so don't use high rarity caches carelessly.
You can use AI cores in locations with much higher level than you. Collect keys from dungeons to unlock them early.
The rarer the gear, the more levels it will last you. Save your rarer caches for later levels when leveling will take longer.
Dying a lot? Level up your PRINTING RANK to your player level, then print new equipment!
If you are trying to level Medical Science or Ammo Crafting without an immediate need for medicine or ammo, only do so when there is a Frontal Cortex Enhancement up for fast leveling.
Want to quickly level Medical Science or Ammo Crafting? Craft and scrap Pain Away and Energy Cells respectively, then repeat until your desired level.
You can only equip items equal to or below your level.

// Social, Chat, UI, Systems
No friends online to help with that dungeon quest? Try posting your Dungeon ID in the chat!
In the chat terminal, type @[player name here] to mention another player.
Don't forget to send a thank you to @DexterHuang in the chat for making this game.
There's a tutorial under the 'Profile' tab.
We also have a desktop version of this game at cybercodeonline.com!
You can add friends in this game. Just tap on their username and scroll down to "Add to Friend List".
Begging for Global Time Skips is generally frowned upon by the community.
If your game is frozen or you can't move in a dungeon, try closing and reopening the game.
Game broken? Refresh or reload.
AFK never ending? Refresh or reload the game.
Tried refreshing or reloading the game?
Feel free to send unwanted gear to players of the correct level with worse gear.
Be nice to other players. :)
Inventory full? Sell your non-essential items in the player market or to a trader in chat!
Ask your friendly neighbor in chat for prices of assorted items!
Being in a gang has the perks of accessing a few new AFK tasks and the gang dungeon. Plus, playing with others makes the game much better!
Want to be in a gang? You will have to be invited by someone. There is no application button.
If you have a fully cleared dungeon that you would like to leave, it is good etiquette to post an invite to chat before leaving, so that everyone can go and loot the dungeon.
Epic caches cost an arm and a leg. If you are lucky enough to get one at a low level, try selling it to a high-level player in market chat to significantly boost your balance!
Since you can't send BTC to players directly, AI Cores and other items replace BTC in direct trades with the gift function. Stock up when buying items from a trader directly.
Look out for special events like series of calibrations and skips — usually called trains — in Chat now and then. You don't want to miss out on these!
Check the player market often to get an idea of the value of your inventory, and if you should buy or sell your items!
A gear's chance to break in calibration can be lowered by using a global buff in the Arasaka Unit Exchange. Alteratively, locked containers with a rarity of rare or above have a variation that only affects you.
Calibrating gear makes it stronger, but calibrated gear cannot be gifted or sold until you use a [Factory Reset Shard] on it.
Each level of calibration on gear adds more to the item than the last level but is more likely to break the item as well.
You can use AI cores in locations with much higher level than you. Collect keys from dungeons to unlock them early.
Amadon is the game's version of window shopping! Glaze your eyes to the Players Market while waiting for your AFK task to finish! (buying not included)
DO NOT spam to complete the chat quest. It only clogs up chat and may get you muted, temporarily or permanently barring access for key functions like trading. 
Always be wary of people attempting to rip you off on your item by underpricing it. Remember to always check other offers first and choose the best one according to your judgment and situation.
It's fine to talk about real-world events in global chat but keep in mind to respect everyone's opinions and to avoid vulgarity as CyberCodeOnline is an all-ages community.
Items that can be scrapped and give resources should have the red button show SCRAP and not DESTROY.
If you use an autoclicker to spam the button for sending hearts to the skipper you may get shadowbanned for doing so. You have been warned.
You only need to click the heart button once to be entered in the item raffle for sending hearts to the skipper.

// Equipment attributes
BARGAIN does not affect price in player-run stalls.
Some attributes are exclusive to certain kinds of equipment, for example, weapons have no EVADE.
Total STUN caps at only 20%. Some attributes have a much higher ceiling, such as CRIT DAMAGE capping at 200% (220% with base value included).
REGEN and ESCAPE do nothing in nearby enemies battles.
Equipment with higher quality does not always mean its attribute is better, but its primary stat is better at the same level.
BARGAIN equipment is not worth more when sold. Instead, when you wear BARGAIN equipment, anything you sell to NPC will be worth more, and anything you purchase will cost less.
STUN and EVADE stack multiplicatively for a maximum of a 52% chance of not getting hit after attacking. (50.4% chance vs an AGILE enemy)
CRIT CHANCE and CRIT DAMAGE are sought-after modules as they help speed up the time to complete a dungeon by increasing your DPS.
CRIT DAMAGE's 200% cap applies to the BONUS CRIT DAMAGE and not the base CRIT DAMAGE for a total of 220% when fully capped.
BARGAIN on your main gear set is worthless, since it is unessential for combat and you can just swap to a BARGAIN set when you need to purchase or sell items.
POCKETs are increasingly helpful the longer you play as you get more items clogging your inventory. Either do a cleanup of those items or invest in a better backpack when necessary.
Gear and upgrades "of expansion" increase your POCKET stat and thus inventory size!
Each percentage-based mod can have a bonus of up to 5%, with the exceptions of a maximum of 7% HEALING MULTIPLIER and 10% CRIT DAMAGE.
Need some extra space in your inventory? Equip gear or modules with the POCKET modifier.
HEALING MULTIPLIER allows you to use lower tiers of medicine or use your current medicine less. This is heavily useful if you want to save medicine and thus medical tech parts.
Calibrating gear significantly buffs the value of all attributes and is highly recommended on gear with good attributes attached to it.
To maximize your CRIT CHANCE using only a single piece of gear and no mods, roll for a CRIT CHANCE 25 weapon on an epic weapon and calibrate it to +10. Level 150-200+ advised before attempting.

// Combat, Enemies, Allies
Always carry heals and ammo on you while in a dungeon.
Your health goes back to full after each street battle or exiting a dungeon!
You always attack first, so make good use of that advantage!
Shields regenerate after you defeat an enemy, regardless if you are fighting in the streets or dungeons.
Craft or buy healing items such as Pain Away to be able to recover health between fights in dungeons.
Take note of enemies described as Tough, Angry, Mad, Agile, Shielded, Marksman, or Berserker. They are more powerful than usual, but give better rewards!
Secret keys are needed to access higher level stations; search dungeons for their fragments!
Remember the CCO mantra: Hit, Heal, Hit...
Challenge dungeons always have a difficult boss, so don't forget to take your friends with you when venturing into one of them.
When you die, you'll lose 10% of the total experience to go to the next level and 10% of your held BTC, so be careful!
If you die with under 10% of the progress to the next level, you will go down a level. Be careful to not die!
You can't enter a dungeon that is 13 levels above your level. It's for your good.
Are you at Death's door in the middle of the treasure room? Ask for support in the chat and direct them to your dungeon!
Are enemies taking too long to kill? Try increasing your critical chance and critical damage modifier.
You can enter dungeons already in progress to get quests and loot!
Consider swapping to better healing items when the current ones you're using heal less than 50% of your health.
Don't forget to craft healing items before diving into the dungeon!
Tough enemies deal more damage than normal enemies, so have your healing items at the ready.
There's a maximum of 4 enemies in a non-boss dungeon room.
Boss rooms in challenge and gang dungeons have a guaranteed locked container, as well as a boss that drops massive loot and a capacity of 6 enemies.
While challenge dungeons are harder than normal ones, the boss in challenge dungeons gives a ludicrous amount of experience and loot.
Want to make sure everyone gets loot in a public dungeon? Make sure everyone deals at least 20% of the mob's max HP as damage.
No more than 5 players can kill an enemy and get XP and loot, so keep your dungeon party at most this size and preferably have at most 4 members.
In public dungeons, everyone can get loot lying inside the dungeon room. No need to worry about any of it being stolen!
If you are annoyed by kill-stealing, it's time to try adding a password to your dungeons.
Angry and Mad enemies are quicker to kill than Tough, Marksman, Agile, or Shielded enemies.
You can join a dungeon without fighting anything. Use it to your advantage, including completing quests or taking keys.
DO NOT push your luck if you feel your health is just enough to take another hit. Losing 1 piece of medicine hurts less than doing your calculations wrong and losing 10% of a level.
If you press an attack button and the game lags, DO NOT SPAM ATTACK! Wait, refresh, or restart the game.
If you believe you clicked on an enemy but the game claims that "Nothing is found", DON'T CLICK "Go back", you should refresh the game.
Berserker Enemies do not have a tooltip for their buffs. Instead, you can only see it through higher than usual HP and Shield as well as in the name.
Preparing a burst of dungeon grinding? Try saving up quests that give buffs and use them all at once to do dungeons faster and consume less medicine.
You can switch equipment during a dungeon.
Dungeons are a great source of AI Cores and Hash Processors.
Some healing items such as Pain Away Spray heal your teammates as well, at the cost of healing less per person. However, they tend to produce lag and are usually discouraged in dungeons, both team and solo.
Opening boxes in dungeons is advised when you defeat all enemies in a room. In some of these boxes, there will be a Techno Thief with absurdly good rewards upon killing it.
The boss has around 20x the HP of a regular enemy, but the CCO mantra of Hit, Heal, Hit, Heal,... still applies, just with a longer repetition time.
Enemies do not do any actions while healing, and only attack right after an attack of your own. Use this fact to heal right after an enemy hits you.
