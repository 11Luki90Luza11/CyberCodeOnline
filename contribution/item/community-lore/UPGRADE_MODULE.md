The Modulus of Shielding is a relatively low-tier cybernetic module developed by the company "Ares Technologies". It was specifically designed to provide a basic level of protection, suitable for everyday life rather than intense combat scenarios. The module functions by creating a thin, barely visible defensive field around the wearer, capable of deflecting minor physical impacts and absorbing low-intensity energy blasts.
Despite its modest capabilities, the Modulus of Shielding remains a popular choice due to its affordability and easy integration with standard cybernetic systems.
