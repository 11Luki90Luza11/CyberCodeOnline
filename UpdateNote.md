-   Added thanksgiving event, during event period, Scavenging and AKF farm bot will drop `Roasted Turkey` rarely.
    - Comsuming Roasted Turkey gives your `AFK EXP Boost` effect for 20 minutes, during this status effect, AFK tasks completed will gain +20% EXP. Please note, the bonus EXP check is when you finish your AFK task not when the task started; so in order to receive the bonus EXP, please ensure that the buff is active when your AFK task finishes.
